## Special FX

### Description

Here's just a few special effects which I have thought of to do with a picture because I've seen an interest in the subject at PSC (laser effects - whoever first thought of it well done). With this code you can make any picture wave like a flag and animate it to flip as if it were a 2D piece of card being turned over. Both these effects can be applied horizontally or vertically. There is also a bonus zoom effect thrown in there. All effects can have the speed adjusted for different tastes/PC's.
